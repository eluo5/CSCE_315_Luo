            <br> This was a semester-long project I worked on with <a href="https://www2.math.tamu.edu/directory/formalpg.php?user=treschgd">Garrett Tresch</a>. In this presentation, we introduce some well-known problems involving graph algorithms and manners of finding approximate solutions using relaxation and linear programming techniques. In particular, we focus on the Sparsest-Cut Problem. After introducing concepts from metric geometry, including embeddability and distortion, we explain how one can obtain an O(log(n)) estimation for the Sparsest-Cut Problem in polynomial time.

            <br> This was a project created during the <a href="https://tamuhack.com/th">TAMU Hack 2023</a> using React, Flask, and MongoDB. It was created within 24 hours and essentially helps someone through the process of getting sick. A user can begin by using the search feature to find suitable medication based on their symptoms. From there with a couple of clicks they can add that to their daily schedule and the app will send updates throughout the day to remind them to take that medication until they are well again. They can use the website as a sort of checklist so that they do not forget when the last time they took the medication was. <br>
