        The Aggie Competitive Programming Club serves the student body of Texas A&M by providing members with the opportunity to learn, practice, and teach others competitive programming techniques and algorithmic problem-solving skills. As an officer,
        I help organize weekly meetings, problem sets, and other events for the club. I also help write problems for our Fall and Spring programming competitions.

          Mu Alpha Theta is the National High School and Two-Year College Mathematics Honor Society. I was the volunteering coordinator at the branch from the Texas Academy of Mathematics & Science. As the volunteering coordinator, I constantly needed to reach out to other colleges, organizations, and companies, looking for new ways to give back to the community. Some of the specific opportunities that I was able to secure for the club were weekly trips to elementary schools across Denton and weekly trips to local libraries to help students who lack educational opportunities obtain free math tutoring. Each of these opportunities were rather difficult to obtain, requiring hundreds of emails being sent to schools across the North Texas area. These emails would often go unreplied requiring several follow up emails to finally gain some traction. Finally after some time, we had several schools interested in allowing us to send our small groups to meet with their students weekly. This was truly an unforgettable experience, seeing each student build a bond with their mentor and each having something to look forward to every week. Unfortunately just when things were getting good, that's when Covid-19 hit. From there, we began to look for new opportunities, specifically ones that were online only and wouldn't require any physical contact. Our idea was to instead host these mentoring sessions through Zoom. Although from this point the sessions weren't nearly as exciting as the in-person ones, it still gave the children and volunteers a chance to interact with others during a time of isolation. We were able to make the best out of what we had at the time. Today, volunteering at the Texas Academy of Mathematics & Science branch of Mu Alpha Theta is going better than ever before. We now have groups that coach high school math teams, groups that continue visiting elementary schools every week, groups that help run high school math competitions, and many more.
